## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install flask.

```bash
pip install flask
```
For the database, SQLAlchemy is required.

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

These are all required dependencies.

This includes only the Server side of the project. All Raspberry Pi clients along with their sensors must forward data to the server through sockets.
